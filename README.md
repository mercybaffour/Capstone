Final capstone project 

**Automating the Data Collection and Preprocessing Phases for Data Scientist Students to Construct Machine Learning Model Projects for Drug Discovery**

**Overview:**
I built a web page that allows data science students to start their first project. The web page will allow students to download biological activity data of compounds from ChEBL API. This is a test project that simulates making the data collection and data pre-processing steps easier for data scientist students. Data scientist students can use this data to construct machine learning models. QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship) models hold great value for drug discovery efforts, particularly in designing effective drugs. Website idea will be for students to query target keywords (target organisms/proteins) from ChEMBL API and they will received a processed file of compounds that will be relevant to build a QSAR model.

**Web Page Layout - List of Pages and Features:**

HOME - Present tool for students to download processed CSV file.

ABOUT- explain what the QSAR predictive model is and its use for drug discovery

FEATURES - Download file and display compound structures

RESOURCES - More resources on bioactive compounds/entities for research
