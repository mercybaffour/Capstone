Final capstone project 

**Automating the Data Collection and Preprocessing Phases for Data Scientist Students to Construct Machine Learning Model Projects for Drug Discovery**

**Overview:**
Retrieve and download biological activity data of compounds from ChEBL API. This will be a test/sample project that simulates making the data collection and data pre-processing steps easier for data scientist students.  Data scientist students can use this data to construct machine learning models. QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship) models hold great value for drug discovery efforts, particularly in designing effective drugs. Website idea will be for students to query target keywords (target organisms/proteins) from ChEMBL API that will be relevant to build a QSAR model. Data retrieved will be outputted to a CSV that they can use for their modeling and drug discovery efforts.
